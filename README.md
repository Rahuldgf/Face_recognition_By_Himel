# Face_recognition_By_Himel
Developed a face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. The project involves face detection using Haar cascades, training with LBPH algorithm, and recognizing faces from a dataset. It operates offline, ensuring accurate identification without requiring real-time processing.

📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a complete Face Recognition System built using Python and OpenCV, designed to detect, train, and recognize human faces from a webcam or image dataset. It uses classical computer vision techniques, particularly Haar Cascade Classifiers for face detection and Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) for recognition.

While real-time processing is optional, the project showcases efficient face detection and identification using a pre-trained model on a labeled dataset. It’s ideal for offline use cases such as attendance systems, identity authentication, or entry access control, making it suitable for academic purposes and company evaluations.
